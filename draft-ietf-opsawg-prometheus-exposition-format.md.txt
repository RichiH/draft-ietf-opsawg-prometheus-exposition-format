Appendix A.  History

   The original Prometheus prototype exposition format used JSON text as
   the default.  JSON is slow and cannot have it data model structure
   defined in one single place like a IDL.  Numerous encoders/decoders
   use runtime reflection to attempt to map field values back to fields
   on dumb data objects (DDO).  This meant routine schema changes would
   break legacy Prometheus servers or clients.  Further all Prometheus
   metrics are floats, and JSON lacked standardization around NAN and
   INF.

   Protocol Buffers were a natural choice since they were mature,
   production ready, and defined the data model in a single source IDL
   file (.proto) that the protoc compiler emits into user code.  If one
   designs the Protocol Buffer schema correctly, it is nearly 100
   percent compatible with future changes on both server/client end.  It
   is also fast.  The internal encoding scheme that Prometheus uses is a
   variation of RecordIO (you'll find that if you lookup Sawzall), which
   is a minimized version of an internal encoding scheme used at Google.
   It makes Protocol Buffer message streams appendable and support near
   random traversal.  It also means decoding can be done incrementally ,
   which saves resources.  This is not a possibility in most JSON
   implementations.  Basically this is the textbook reason why folks use
   Protocol Buffers.  Why not Avro or Message Pack?  They were immature
   and lacked the single site IDL file.  Why not Thrift?  It is an
   inferior reverse engineering of Protocol Buffers, and many of its
   language-specific generated code emitters exhibited bugs and
   inconsistencies (e.g., in 2012, the encoding for the first enum value
   in Thrift in its binary wire format was "0" or "1" depending on which
   language you used even from the same Thrift release).  Sorry, that is
   Mickey Mouse stuff.

   The text format emerged strictly to support two cases: no Protocol
   Buffer support in an environment (e.g., shell script) and support
   one-off human debugging.

   The binary format was also designed to not be stateful, meaning each
   individual decoded message from the stream could be treated in
   isolation.  The text format lacks this: state spans multiple lines.
   This increases complexity.

   Because gRPC did not exist at the time and Thrift had defects, HTTP
   was the common denominator for transport that supports both binary
   and text formats.  The final protocol version uses HTTP MIME type
   autonegotiation to resolve whether binary or text is used.  Previous
   versions used HTTP request headers, but that is a poor practice.  I
   had considered using different named endpoints (/metrics.pb or
   /metrics.txt) for different formats (a la REST), but that would have
   increased complexity with middleware registration in each client
   library.  HTTP MIME auto-negotiation is standardized too and
   predictable.

   The metrics in the binary format are done as concrete types (as
   opposed to loose key-value pairs as some had proposed).  That takes
   guess work out of clients' interpretation of them.  Protocol Buffers
   did not have union "oneof" or "any" support at that time (became
   public last year).  This necessitated the creation of the separate
   per-metric enum field to instruct which concrete metric type was
   populated: counter, gauge, histogram, summary, untyped.  This meant
   the server could perform loose invariant enforcement and reject bad
   messages (e.g., a metric that populated both gauge and histogram
   fields).  Were I to do this format over again, I would deprecated the
   individual gauge, counter, histogram nested fields in the metric
   entry and replace it with a "oneof".  I am unsure this would be wise:
   I do not think Protocol Buffer 3 ("any", "oneof", and map) support is
   sufficiently universal in the public ecosystem to warrant a
   conversion.  This might be worth fixing in two years.  Google is
   working on and publishing more official Protocol Buffer language
   integrations.

   Why pull not push for transport?  Push requires a HA receiver for the
   metrics and possibly for the metrics producers/clients to maintain
   more state on the receiver, what has been sent, how old, publication
   interval, extra configuration, etc.  Pull was simply easier.  It also
   meant all that a client required was to have support for HTTP, which
   is ubiquitous.  Supporting push directly is more practical these
   days, but ...

   In terms of metric design (not wire format), these metric types match
   most software, industrial, and sciences use cases.  Other metric
   types could be added later if the needs warrant it.
